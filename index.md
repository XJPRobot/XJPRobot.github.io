As our population ages, the elderly face numerous health management and psychological challenges. These issues arise from a combination of age-related physical decline, cognitive changes, and the emotional impact of being separated from family and friends. Common problems include a lack of awareness of physical abnormalities, cognitive decline, difficulty obtaining timely medical advice, challenges in adjusting diet and exercise habits, forgetting to take medication on time, poor access to medical information, and a lack of companionship.

Our innovative solution addresses these concerns through an advanced AI system that combines a free-moving small AI robot with a user-friendly cell phone APP. This system features a fluffy, healing appearance pet hardware designed to provide comfort and companionship. By integrating a large language model with a locally collected database—including historical cases, testing indicators, and Q&A—we generate a personalized health management model for each elderly individual.
